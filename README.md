You can start work on the dds-fmu in the src/ folder
Read up on the src/documentation/ folder to get a better grasp of how to use and manipulate the src

Once you are done and satisfied with the result, compress the whole src into a .fmu file using this shel scrips:
./compress_to_FMU

Now you should see that all the changes that you have made in the code reflect in the "dds-fmu.fmu" file
